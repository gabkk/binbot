Use it to test binance API

If you want to try the api:

$ touch credential
$ echo -e "CLES=XX \nSECRET=XX \n" > credential #replace XX with your credential


At the root directory start a python interpreter and copy this:

from binance.client import Client
def get_credential():
    filepath = 'credential'
    cles = ""
    secret = ""
    with open(filepath) as fp:
        for cnt, line in enumerate(fp):
            if "SECRET" in line:
                secret = line.split("=", 2)[1][:-1]
            elif "CLES" in line:
                cles = line.split("=", 2)[1][:-1]
    return cles, secret

cles, secret = get_credential()
client = Client(cles, secret)
client.get_symbol_ticker()

you can try api function now:
